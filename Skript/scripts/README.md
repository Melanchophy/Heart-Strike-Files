The file structure in the server is setup so that skript can read and load the files in the correct order that they should be loaded.

E.G. we preferably want all of the functions and the server's 'hard' variables loaded first.

/0_%name%/ # Clears then loads all of our server variables
			# If a list of variables is only related to 
/1_%name%/ # Useful and/or general Functions
/2_%name%/ # Commands
/3_%name%/ # Environmental
/4_%name%/ # Regions
/5_%name%/ # GUI
/6_%name%/ # NPCs
/7_%name%/ # Player Stuff
/8_%name%/ # 
/9_%name%/ #
