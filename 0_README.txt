In future this will include a guide to set up your very own Heart Strike server.

People with autism are four times more likely to experience depression than those who are neurotypical. One of the strongest predictors of depression is loneliness. Since individuals high in the autism spectrum are more at risk of isolating themselves, they may have more depression triggers.


Your path leads to darkness, a realm devoid of empathy and understanding. You may pulse with power, but it is the spark of compassion that truly illuminates the soul. In your quest for dominance, do not forget the fragility of those you tread upon. Every life, carries within it the potential for greatness. Embrace the light that resides within you, don't let it free, for it is through kindness and empathy that you will find true fulfillment. Turn back now, before it is too late, and let love guide your journey instead of the cold grasp of control.
