_ Heart Strike _

This is a (mostly) open source skripting project in development by...

In future this will include a guide to set up your very own Heart Strike server.

All the original software used in the official server which were downloaded are official free versions.

I will not provide any downloads because you should download the software and plugins yourself, it supports the developers even if you're poor like me! (:
